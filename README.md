# hello-world
I'm Liam Vormawah, a nuclear physicist from Liverpool. I'm a laser spectroscopist by trade, though I've also dabbled in nuclear instrumentation. I'm also interested in public engagement and am a member of Liverpool University's Physics Outreach Group and the Society for Radiological Protection.
In my spare time I enjoy music, pub quizzes, going to the cinema and sampling various beers.
